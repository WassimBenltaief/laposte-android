La Poste Android
=========

## An android application for the Tunisian mail service.

[![Laposte logo](/laposte-android/blob/master/img/laposte_new.png)](#logo)


### Why in GitHub :

This is a project about developing an android application for the Tunisian Mail Service.
All the work was done in collaboration with the administration of the mail service, but because of the bureaucratic structure that blocked the integration stage of this application !!! I decided to stop with them and share the work to public in order to organize, correct and participate with others the developement stage. Feel free to share, use and participate.
